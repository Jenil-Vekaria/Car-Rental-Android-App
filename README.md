For CPS510-Database System we chose to do Car Rental topic and we designed a Java GUI for it. 
However, I wanted it take it bit furthur and decided to build a mobile app for it, so here are the screenshots below of my mobile app.

This app has a login page where users can sign up. Once logged in, you can choose any car category you like. You will then be directed to another page where all the available car for that category is displayed along with their daily rate. If you wish, you can book a car by providing your personal information and do the necessary payment. Once you have done the payment, your booking is finally complete. Now you can view all your bookings, or return the car or browse through all the cars.
